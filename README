I'm getting unexpected results with POE::Component::IRC::State's
irc_chan_mode and channel_ban_list when used with
POE::Component::IRC::Plugin.

The bot_noplugin version which doesn't use POE::Component::IRC::Plugin
works as expected.  When executing

    /mode #moses bb one!*@* two!*@*

from my IRC client, irc_chan_mode returns once for each ban and on both occassions
channel_ban_list('#moses') returns the expected output, i.e. 2 entries.

However, in the non POE::Component::IRC::Plugin version of the bot,
irc_chan_mode again returns once for each ban as expected, but the first time
channel_ban_list('#moses') returns no entries and the second time it
returns just one entry.
